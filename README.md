## 📜 Abstract

**PalmScore** introduces a novel approach to LLM-as-a-judge, enabling fine-grained, flexible, and reliable evaluation for tasks like model response assessment and data synthesis. Unlike traditional prompt-based or finetuning-based evaluators, which often struggle with judge performance or generalization, our method leverages **layer-wise aggregated logits** from a general LLM. 

Inspired by the insight that middle-to-top layers capture critical judgment information, we aggregate logits across all layers using lightweight weight parameters, keeping the LLM backbone frozen. This results in a robust and fine-grained judgment score. 

🔍 **Key Highlights**:
- Outperforms baseline methods on **Flask**, **HelpSteer**, and **BIGGen** benchmarks.
- Achieves comparable or superior performance to reasoning-based baselines, even without reasoning.
- Excels in downstream tasks like **data selection**, **Sentiment Understanding** and **knowledge boundary detection**.

## 🛠️ Environment Setup

Follow the instructions below to set up the environment.

```bash
# Create a new conda environment
conda create --name PalmScore python=3.10 

# Activate the environment
conda activate PalmScore

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Laip11/PalmScore.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd PalmScore

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔬Experiments
> We provide the running scripts for all experiments in the paper in the [scripts](./scripts) directory. In these files, we include code examples for execution, and you can adjust the specific parameters according to your needs.

> You must first run the script `scripts/run_direct.sh` to obtain the results of the corresponding model on the valid_data.


Note: Please make appropriate adjustments based on your local computing resources. Slight variations in the results may occur due to the influence of batch size, which is a normal behavior.

1. **Main experiments**
> Here, we take the evaluation of the Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model on Flask as an example.

```bash
# Direct condiiton 
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 palmscore/get_pointwise_outputs.py \
     --model_name_or_path LLM-Research/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct \
     --save_dir results \
     --points 5 \
     --batch_size 4 \
     --max_new_tokens 10 \
     --dtype bfloat16 \
     --input_file data/main/flask.json

## You can modify the parameters in the `scripts/run_direct.sh` script and then run it.
## bash scripts/run_direct.sh

# Reasoning condition
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 palmscore/get_pointwise_outputs.py \
      --model_name_or_path  LLM-Research/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct \
      --save_dir results \
      --points 5 \
      --batch_size 4 \
      --max_new_tokens 256 \
      --with_feedback \
      --dtype bfloat16 \
      --input_file data/main/flask.json

## You can modify the parameters in the `scripts/run_reasoning.sh` script and then run it.
## bash scripts/run_reasoning.sh

```
You can run the `evaluation.py` script to obtain the results after generating the data_res and valid_data_res files corresponding to the model. For example,
```bash
## Evaluate Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct’s performance on Flask under the “Direct” condition.
python evaluation.py \
  --data_path results/flask/Meta-Llama-3___1-8B-Instruct_logits.json \
  --valid_data_path results/valid/Meta-Llama-3___1-8B-Instruct_logits.json
```
2. **Instruction Data Selection**

Note: Please make sure that your model is consistent with your `valid_data_path`.

In this experiment, you need to assign scores for seven evaluation criteria, specifically including `answer_accuracy`, `logical_consistency`, `relevance`, `fluency_and_clarity` ,`length_appropriateness`, `diversity`, and `instruction_difficulty`. Please make sure to have collected the scores for all evaluation criteria before proceeding with supervised fine-tuning.
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 palmscore/sft_data_filtering.py \
      --data_path sft_prompt_7type.jsonl\
      --aspect answer_accuracy \
      --batch_size 16 \
      --model_name_or_path LLM-Research/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct

## You can modify the parameters in the `scripts/run_sft_data_filtering.sh` script and then run it.
## bash scripts/run_sft_data_filtering.sh
```

3. **Self Knowledge**

Note: Please make sure that your model is consistent with your `valid_data_path`.
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python palmscore/self-knowledge.py \
    --model LLM-Research/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct \
    --valid_data_path results/valid/Meta-Llama-3___1-8B-Instruct_logits.json \
    --in_file data/self-knowledge/prompt_unknow.json

## You can modify the parameters in the `scripts/run_self_knowledge.sh` script and then run it.
## bash scripts/run_self_knowledge.sh
```
4. **Sentiment Understanding**

Note: Please make sure that your model is consistent with your `valid_data_path`.
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python palmscore/sentiment_understanding.py \
        --model_path LLM-Research/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct \
        --valid_data_path results/valid/Meta-Llama-3___1-8B-Instruct_logits.json 

## You can modify the parameters in the `scripts/run_sentiment_understanding.sh` script and then run it.
## run scripts/run_sentiment_understanding.sh
```

5. **Ablation Experiment**

- First, obtain the results of InternLM3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-V0.3 on Flask under the direct condition.
- Then you need to change the `scores` in the `print_correlations` function of the `palmscore/evaluation.py` file.
```python
# Original variable
#scores = ['direct_score','weighted_score','palmscore_wo','palmscore_w']

# Modified variable
scores = ['direct_score','weighted_score','palmscore_wo','palmscore_w','avg_direct_score_ls','avg_weighted_score'，'weighted_weighted_score_ls','avg_logits_weighted_score_ls']
```
- You can obtain the ablation experiment results by following run the `evaluation.py`
